# Through The Valleys Wabbajack

## Introduction

Welcome to the readme for Through The Valleys! This modlist is a lightweight but comprehensive overhaul of Oblivion tailored to provide a stable, high performing, and most importantly fun, vanilla+ experience. The [original guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/51105?tab=description) was created by [PushTheWinButton](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/users/13822205), and the Wabbajack version is created and maintained by yours truly.

It is imperative that you thoroughly and completely read through the instructions contained in this readme, especially if you have never installed a list using Wabbajack before. Should you need support, please double check that you have not missed any steps, and then seek support in the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack).

## Requirements

* A clean install of Oblivion GOTY Deluxe Edition in English for Steam or GOG
* 12 GB of free space
  * 6 GB for Oblivion
  * 2 GB for downloads
  * 4 GB for the install
* A NexusMods account, preferably with Premium.

## Installation

### Setting up Wabbajack

If you have never used Wabbajack before, please follow the instructions in this section. If you are familiar with the program, feel free to skip this section.

* You likely already have this installed, but in case you haven't. This package is required for MO2 and you can download it from Microsoft. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Direct Link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
* [Download Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases/download/2.5.2.1/Wabbajack.exe) and place it in a folder that is *not* windows-protected (this includes, Documents, Downloads, Program Files, etc). 
* Run the Wabbajack.exe. When you run the exe it will automatically download and install the latest release.
* You will need to log in to your Nexus Mods accounts in Wabbajack. It is highly recommended to purchase Nexus Premium in order to access uncapped download speeds and automated downloads. You will not need to log in to any other sites for the purposes of this list.

### Setting up Oblivion

In order to properly install the list, you will need a clean install of Oblivion. The only supported version of Oblivion for this list is the English version Oblivion GOTY Deluxe. Either the steam or GOG versions will work. You cannot install this list without owning all the dlc, when not using the English version, or when using a pirated copy.

* If you already have Oblivion installed, uninstall it through Steam or GOG. Delete the files within your library as well as in your "My Games" folder in documents.
* Install Oblivion to a nonprotected folder. You can use [this tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) to change the location of your steam library.
  * Typically, installing the game and modlist to an SSD will show increased performance compared to an HDD
* If you use steam, disable the steam overlay.
* Run the Oblivion Launcher, navigate to settings and select Ultra High Quality. Select the appropriate resolution from you and tick windowed mode on. Oblivion by default does not allow HDR and anti-aliasing to be enabled at the same time. I keep HDR on and anti-aliasing off. I suggest you use the same settings, but your mileage may vary.
* Press ok and launch the game, exiting once you reach the main menu.

### Installing the list

Assuming you have followed the previous steps correctly, the list is now ready to be downloaded.

* Navigate to the gallery in Wabbajack and download the latest version of Through The Valleys. 
  * If the list is shown as under maintenance, it is unavailable to install at that time.
* Now select where you would like to install the list. As always, avoid protected folders. 
  * If you plan to install multiple lists for Oblivion, you can use the same download folder for each of them in order to save space.
* Click the start button and let it run. This will take anywhere from around 20 minutes to a couple hours.

### Post Installation

After wabbbajack displays the installation as complete, you may move on to this step.

* Close wabbajack and navigate to your installation folder.
* Copy the *contents* of the "Game Folder Files" Folder to where your *Oblivion.exe is located*
* Run the 4gb patch and apply it to OblivionLauncher.exe and Oblivion.exe.

This step is imperative and skipping it will cause your game to not run.

### Updating

Updating follows the same steps as installing, simply download the new version of the list and point Wabbajack at your existing installation.

* Updating will delete any files that you have edited and revert any changes you have made
* Updates may not always be save file compatible, please check the release notes and always make backups of your saves.
* Updating is never required, and if you are enjoying the list with no problems, feel free to ignore any updates.


# Final Steps

* Run Mod Organizer 2 from within the installation folder.
* Optionally, if you would like nicer distant LOD at a very high performance cost, enable *all* of the mods underneath the LOD separator. Seriously, this will cause stutters.
* Optionally, enable NorthernUIAway under the 'UI' separator to allow for controller support.
* Optionally, enable "Draz Tweaks" under Final Steps for my personal tweaks. Currently it only increases the amount you can carry.
* If you are using widescreen, use the following instructions, courtesy Sam
 * Open the INI Editor in MO2 (jigsaw/puzzle icon on the top bar).
 * Under [Display], change iSizeW and iSizeH to match your resolution. For example, for 1440p, iSizeW=3440 and iSizeH=1440.
 * Download the Ultra Widescreen Fix for Bevilex from here and install through MO2, placing it in the Final Steps section.
 * Download the Black Rectangle Ultrawide Fix from here, and install through MO2, placing it in the Final Steps section.
* You are now go for launch! The game will always be launched using Oblivion.exe from within MO2. Ignore the OBSE executables!
* Read that again! Launch the game from Oblivion.exe from within MO2!
* A third time! ***LAUNCH THE GAME FROM OBLIVION.EXE FROM WITHIN MO2. DO NOT LAUNCH OBSE!***

## Mods to Get Familiar With

[Ascension](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/50237) totally overhauls the game to be more balanced as well as more difficult. Health is determined solely by endurance. Magicka and fatigue regenerate slower. You can carry less based on your strength. I highly reccommend reading the full log of all the changes in this mod.

[Balanced Unleveled Rewards](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/51050/) (as well as Balanced NPC level cap) remove the dynamic level scaling from the game and replace it with a more sensical static rebalance of items.

[Simple Saves Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/51122) completely replaces the vanilla autosave system. Force an autosave using a hotkey, default is numpad 0.

[Simple Horse Utilities](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/51197) adds a spell that lets you call your horse, as well as adds saddlebags (Sneak and interact with horse to open).

[Teleportation Services](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/50141), Ascension removes the vanilla fast travel points available to you at the beginning of the game, but fear not as Teleportation Services have you covered. Adds teleporation (for a fee) at the Mages Guild and Nine Divines Wayshrines.


## Common Issues

The game will not launch.

* Sometimes, the Oblivion.ini is not correctly initialized. Repeat the installation, be sure to run the Oblivion Launcher and rerun Wabbajack.

Strange physics issues, sped up or slowed down animation times.

* Possible fixes including capping your framerate to 60 in your graphics drivers software (Nvidia or AMD), or disabling the fps fix in the Oblivion display tweaks ini.

Cursor is not locking or has issues with multiple monitors.

* Set bBackgroundMouse to 0 in your oblivion.ini

OBSE is not running properly, the game is not fullscreen, etc.

* Make sure you followed the installation steps exactly and are running Oblivion.exe from mod organizer 2.

Low carry weight, getting overencumbered easily.

* This is intended behavior, if you don't like it, feel free to tweak Ascension's ini to increase your base carry weight.

FlipExSwap/D3D9.dll errors.

* You have an ENB or something similar installed. The configuration of Oblivion display tweaks used in this list is incompatible with ENB.

## Troubleshooting and Support

Support is available in the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack). The staff is made up solely of volunteers, so please have patient when seeking support. We cannot offer support if you add or remove any mods from the list.

Furthermore, Oblivion is an old game. It frequently strange issues with new hardware. If you run into a bug or crash, load up the game to see if it happens consistently. I also recommend googling solutions for in game errors before asking for support. For example, AMD graphics cards are notoriously buggy with Oblivion, but there are workarounds online. I wish that I and the rest of the team were familiar with every possible glitch in Oblivion but that is simply not possible.

## Addition or Removal of mods

Understandably, you may be interested in editing the list to suit your personal tastes. If you wish to pursue this, please do not ask for help in the support channel for the list, and stick to the general oblivion channel. I'm always happy to help people learn to mod, but I suggest reading over [these tutorials](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/wiki) compiled by Lively to get started.
